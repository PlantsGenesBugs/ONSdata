## Vital statistics in the UK: marriages, civil partnerships and divorce

Data was obtained from the [Annual UK and constituent country figures for marriages, divorces and civil partnerships](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/vitalstatisticspopulationandhealthreferencetables) in September 2023, and is downloadable from this repository ([annualreferencetables2021.xlsx](https://github.com/PlantsGenesBugs/ONSdata/blob/main/samesex_marriage/annualreferencetables2021.xlsx)).

All values are total counts (not rates), since rates have been calculated using the population as a whole and, since same-sex marriages represent a small proportion of the whole, it makes the comparison less clear. Marriages of same sex couples have been possible in England and Wales since 29 March 2014, in Scotland since 31 December 2014 and in Northern Ireland since 13 January 2020. Marriages involving couples who converted an existing civil partnership into a marriage are not included in the data set. 

In terms of population size, based on ONS data from 2021, if England's population is normalised to 100%, then the relative estimated populations of Scotland is 9.7%, Wales is 5.5% and Northern Ireland is 3.4%. Therefore we could expect a similar proportionality in same sex marriages/civil partnerships (all things being equal).

### Same-sex civil partnerships
The Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on 5 December 2005. Even though this meant only a few weeks were available to apply for civil partnership in this year, some people managed to secure this successfully. There was a large uptake in 2005 and then a fairly steady decline in most countries except for Northern Ireland. The decrease in numbers of civil partnerships in 2014 aligns with the passing of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act in 2013. It is also notable that there isn't a big difference in civil partnership numbers between male and female couples (although it appears that uptake by female same-sex couples is higher).

### Same-sex marriage
The first same-sex marriage in the UK took place on 29 March 2014 in all countries except Northern Ireland, which only allowed this since 13 January 2020. In general, there are more female same-sex marriages than male, and more marriages in England than the other countries (but this is expected due to the differences in total population).

### Same-sex divorces
The data on divorces are really limited. In England & Wales it has gone up (possibly in line with the number of marriages - being able to calculate rates here would be useful!) However, because wedding totals in England & Wales aren't reflected by the individual country's numbers (according to ONS notes in spreadsheet) no conclusion can be drawn about total number of marriages (cummulatively over time) and divorces in any given year using the data set I prepared. In addition, civil partnerships that were converted to marriages have been excluded from the data, so conclusions have to be drawn carefully.

Further analysis could be done by comparing relative population sizes and the relative amounts of marriages/divorces (to see if there's proportionally more or less between countries). The cultures between the constituent countries of the UK are distinct and this could affect behaviour where this is concerned.
